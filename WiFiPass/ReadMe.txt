Free program for retrieving all saved Wi-Fi passwords on your Windows PC you may
have forgotten, without having to use the netsh wlan commands or digging through
your Network Settings.

Wi-Fi Pass is a very simple C# application built on .NETCore (5.0) for Windows.
I created this application as a challenge to create the simplest Windows app I
could think of that's still useful and worth having. It occurred to me that I
would definitely like to have a faster way to view and copy all of my saved
Wi-Fi passwords on my PC when someone asks me for a password I can't remember
off the top of my head, so I created this application to do just that. The app
was actually written in about 2 or 3 hours, maximum. I actually spent the most
time on creating the icon for it in Photoshop 2020, and also on cleaning up
all the code and files to publish it on GitHub. As I often say: "The coding
is the easy part"!

Wi-Fi Pass is free and open source. It costs nothing to use or share with others.
You can also view all of its code to learn from it and create your own apps.
It requires no special installation other than saving it on your PC, and when
you want to remove it simply delete the entire folder and it is completely gone.
It makes no modifications to the Windows Registry or any system files/folders.
If you like this app, please share the GitHub download link with others you
think might like it as well:

Installation and Use:
-----------------------------------

No special installation or installer is required, and the app can be removed by 
simply deleting it from your hard-drive or sending it to the Recycle Bin 
(nothing is left behind). To use the app you only need to download it and extract 
the files from the archive file somewhere ...

If you don't know how to use an archive file, follow these steps:
1)  Simply download either the .zip or .7z archive containing the application files
2)  Open the archive by double-clicking it or right-clicking it and selecting the appropriate action in the context menu ...
        *For 7Zip, just right-click the .7z file and select 7Zip >> Open Archive in the context menu
3)  Click & drag the entire WifiPass folder from the archive to where you want to store it on your PC
4)  Open the folder and you'll see WifiPass.exe, a shortcut named Wi-Fi Pass and some program files inside ...
        *Double-click either WifiPass.exe or the Wi-Fi Pass shortcut to run the app
5)  Optional: Copy + Paste the Wi-Fi Pass shortcut on your desktop so you can run it from your desktop anytime by double-clicking it
